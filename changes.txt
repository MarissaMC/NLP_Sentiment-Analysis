The changes I have made include:

## nblearn.py
1 change the classes range from specified ['SPAM','HAM','POS','NEG'] to general classes.
2 can deal with multiclass now
3 change the format of model from one dictionary to nested dictionary.

## nbclassify.py
1 change the judge code according to the model changed in nblearn.py

## spam.nb 
1 changed due to nblearn.py's change

## sentiment.nb
1 changed due to nblearn.py's change

## spam.out
1 even though the result of spam test dataset using revised nblearn.py, nbclassify looks very similar to original one, to gurantee consistency I update it using the newest code.

## sentiment.out
1 even though the result of sentiment test dataset using revised nblearn.py, nbclassify looks very similar to original one, to gurantee consistency I update it using the newest code.

## README.md
As the dev dataset for sentiment used before is 200, which is very small and may be biased, I use new sentiment.nb model to test 3457 instance and get the following result:
